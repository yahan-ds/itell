### Overview

#### Introduction

This document provides guidelines for using iTELL. As a test case, we cover the iTELL adaptation of Principles of Macroeconomics 2e. The textbook was redesigned into an interactive web version by a team comprising a subject matter expert, a content and assessment developer, a multimedia and web developer, and an instructional designer from Georgia Tech.

#### Acknowledgements

We also appreciate Affordable Learning Georgia, the National Science Foundation, and The National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (AI-ALOE) for providing funds to support this project.

#### Making Progress

For most sections, you will be asked to **1)** write a summary, and **2)** answer comprehension questions. You will not be able to proceed to the next Sections of the book without successfully completing the tasks in your current Section or at least making two attempts.

##### 1) Write a Summary

A summary text box is located at the bottom of each page. You will be asked to summarize the contents of the page before you can move on to the next Section. Write a summary and submit it to have it evaluated by the AI tutor.

_> What makes a successful summary_

A successful summary will…

- Be within 50 ~ 200 words long
- Be written in English
- Be on topic
- Not be plagiarized
- Use appropriate language

_> Evaluation_

Your summary will be evaluated by the AI engine and give it a passing or a failing grade. The evaluation will be based on four different factors:

- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Wording</span>: Whether you did a good job
  of paraphrasing words and sentences from the section and using objective
  language.
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Content</span>: Whether you included enough
  key ideas and details from the section to successfully summarize the content,
  and whether your summary focuses on the main ideas of the section and provides
  support for those ideas..
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Topic Borrowing</span>: Whether you did a
  good job of using your own language to describe the main ideas in the section.
- <span style={{ color: "#60a5fa" }}>Topic Similarity</span>: Whether you stayed
  on topic (i.e., whether you found the main ideas of the text and focused your
  summary on those ideas).

_> Feedback_

If your summary fails to pass the evaluation, you will be given additional attempts to revise and resubmit your summary. Click on the _Details_ tab to access more detailed feedback to help you write a better summary.

<Image src="/images/userguide/userguide9.png">
  Summaries that do not receive a passing grade will be given detailed feedback.
</Image>

_> Notes_

- The overview pages of each Chapter will _not have Summary sections_.
- Your past summaries will be accessible from your dashboard.

##### 2) Answer Comprehension Questions

Comprehension questions will be located after one subsection per section. You will have to answer the question correctly before you can proceed to the next section.

### 3. Dashboard

#### Statistics

Access your dashboard's statistics page by clicking on your profile icon at the top right and clicking on the _Dashboard_ button.

From the statistics dashboard, you can access different learning statistics such as your progress (i.e., how many sections you have completed so far), summary statistics (the number of summaries you have submitted and the number of summaries that have passed the evaluation, etc.), and daily reading time. There will also be a quick link to your recent summaries available at the bottom right corner.

#### Summaries

You will be able to access your past summaries in the summaries tab (<span style= {{ color: 'red' }}>**1**</span>) of your dashboard. Below is an overview of the Summaries page’s layout.
