Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals.

- Who organizes and coordinates this system?
- Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants?
- Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry?
- Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible?
- How does it all get done?

There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy: **traditional economy, command economy**, and **market economy**.

    <TabPanel value="traditional">
      Traditional economy is the oldest economic system and is used in parts of
      Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their
      economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition).
      Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the
      crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you consume.
      Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic
      progress or development.
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel value="command">
      Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic
      effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class.
      Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was
      devoted to building pyramids for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is
      another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and
      protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and
      soldiers to do the lord's bidding. In the last century, communist
      governments like Cuba, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union have
      emphasized command economies by centralizing economic planning with the
      state. The government decides what goods and services will be produced,
      what prices will be charged, what methods of production will be used, and
      how much workers will receive for wages. In return, the government
      provides necessities free like healthcare and education.
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel value="market">
      Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic
      decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A market
      is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or
      services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock
      Exchange is a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers
      together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market
      economies are based on private enterprise: private individuals or groups
      of private individuals own and operate the means of production (resources
      and businesses). Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In
      a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and
      businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are.
      A person's income is based on his or her ability to convert resources
      (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society
      values the person's output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or
      LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces, not governments, determine
      economic outcomes.

Most economies in the real world are **mixed economies**, meaning they combine elements of command, market, and even traditional systems. The U.S. economy is a market-oriented mixed economy, whereas many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions. China and Russia remain closer to being command economies, despite transitioning to a more market-oriented system over the past several decades.

### What countries are considered economically free?

Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the _Wall Street Journal_ look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index's category choices and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical discussion of economic freedom.

The 2016 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: Table 1.1 lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country, Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.

The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a _higher level of economic freedom around the world_.

## Regulations: The Rules of the Game

Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies often have **underground economies** (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government's approval.

  The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a
  black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead
  involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom
  and government rules.

## The Rise of Globalization

In recent decades, economies have moved increasingly towards globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.

Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons.

- Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in Figure 1.9, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs.
- Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs.
- Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.

[Table 1.2](#Table_01_02) presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World Bank. **Exports** are the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad. **Imports** are the goods and services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically. **Gross domestic product (GDP)** measures the size of total production in an economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country's total economic production is sold in other countries.

</Caption>

In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.

Table 1.2 indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.

Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback against globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.

Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called [The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics](a-the-use-of-mathematics-in-principles-of-economics). It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.

### Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age

The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the _Farmer's Almanac_, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested.

Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. This social media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.

Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send ten reporters to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!
