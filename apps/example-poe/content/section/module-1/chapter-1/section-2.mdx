Economics is concerned with the well-being of _all_ people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers' skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.

It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two parts: **Microeconomics** focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses. **Macroeconomics** looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance.

Insights about particular plants and animals help researchers to understand the overall food chain, while insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.

Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the macroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual households and businesses make.

## Microeconomics

**Microeconomics** focuses on specific parts of the economy.

**Economists might ask the following questions about consumer behavior:**

- What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets?
- What combination of goods and services will best fit their wants and needs, given the budget they have to spend?
- How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time?
- How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?

**Economists might also ask the following questions about firms and industries:**

- What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell?
- What determines the prices a firm will charge?
- What determines how a firm will produce its products?
- What determines how many workers it will hire?
- How will a firm finance its business?
- When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close?

In the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.

## Macroeconomics

**Macroeconomics** considers the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation.

**Economists might ask the following questions on overall economic policy:**

- What determines the level of economic activity in a society?
- What determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces?
- What determines how many jobs are available in an economy?
- What determines a nationâ€™s standard of living?
- What causes the economy to speed up or slow down?
- What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay them off?
- What causes the economy to grow over the long term?

**We can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals:**

1. Growth in the standard of living

2. Low unemployment

3. Low inflation

The three items above are just some of the most important goals.

Those goals are determined in part by a nation's macroeconomic policy. A nation's central bank conducts **monetary policy**, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United States, the Federal Reserve regulates these factors. A nation's legislative body determines **fiscal policy**, which involves government spending and taxes. For the United States, Congress and the executive branch define fiscal policy through the federal budget. Some Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems they encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.

<Warning>

- **monetary policy**: policy that involves altering the level of interest rates, the availability of credit in the economy, and the extent of borrowing

- **fiscal policy**: economic policies that involve government spending and taxes

  This week, Adriene and Jacob teach you about macroeconomics. This is the stuff
  of big picture economics, and the major movers in the economy. Like taxes and
  monetary policy and inflation and policy. We need this stuff, because if you
  don't have a big picture of the economy, crashes and panics are more likely.
