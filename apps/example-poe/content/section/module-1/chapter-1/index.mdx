### Review
> Answer each question.
1. Laquan put \$15 in savings this week. This was \$3 more than the amount he put in savings last week. How much did Laquan put in savings
last week?
2. Joanne bought three times as many books as Mitchell at the book fair. If Mitchell bought 5 books, how many books did Joanne buy?

You know how to make additive and multiplicative comparisons. You can answer questions like, "If Johnny has 6 apples and Suzie has 12 apples, who has more apples?" Are there other ways to compare values?

# session 1 title: "Additive and Multiplicative Reasoning"

<Scenario>
Robena and Eryn each predicted the final score of a basketball game between the Crusaders and the Blue Jays.
</ Scenario>
1. Analyze each prediction.

<Image
  src="/images/module-1/chapter-1/section-1/analyze_predction.png"
  alt="Robena and Eryn's reasoning for their predictions."
  width={700}

<QuestionInputProps 
    question = "a. Describe the reasoning that Robena and Eryn used to make each statement."
></QuestionInputProps>

<QuestionInputProps
    question = "b. Based on the two predictions, which team scored more points in the second half?"
></QuestionInputProps>

One of the students used additive reasoning to make her comparison and the other
used multiplicative reasoning. **Additive reasoning** focuses on the use of addition
and subtraction for comparisons. **Multiplicative reasoning** focuses on the use of
multiplication and division.
<QuestionInputProps question = 
    "Which student used additive reasoning and which used multiplicative reasoning?"
></QuestionInputProps>
Read the age scenario and answer each question.

<Scenario>
Vicki and her nephew Benjamin share the same birthday. They were both born on March 4.
**Vicki**: "Today, I'm 40 years old and you're 10. I'm 4 times as old as you are!"
**Benjamin**: "Wow, you're old!"
**Vicki**: "Yeah, but in 5 years, I'll be 45 and you'll be 15. Then, I will only be three times as old as you."
**Benjamin**: "I'm catching up to you!"
**Vicki**: "And 15 years after that, I'll be 60 and you'll be 30. Then, I'll only be twice as old as you!"
**Benjamin**: "In enough time, I'll be older than you, Aunt Vicki!"
</Scenario>

2. Is Vicki correct about how their ages change? Is Benjamin correct in thinking that he
will eventually be older than his aunt?"
<QuestionInputProps></QuestionInputProps>

3. The table shown represents the different statements between Vicki and Benjamin.
Let V represent Vicki’s age and B represent Benjamin’s age.

# session 2 title: "Comparing Quantities"

Let’s think about a different comparison of two quantities.
<Scenario>
The school colors at Riverview Middle School are a shade of green and white. 
The art teacher, Mr. Raith, knows that to get the correct color of green, it takes 3 parts blue paint to every 2 parts yellow paint.
</Scenario>
There are different ways to think about this
relationship and make comparisons. One way is to
draw a picture or model.
From the model, you can make comparisons of the
different quantities. 
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
            - Blue parts to yellow parts
            - Yellow parts to blue parts
            </td>
            <td>
            - Blue parts to total parts
            - Yellow parts to total parts
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Each comparison is called a ratio. A **ratio** is a comparison of two quantities that uses
division. The comparisons in the first column are part-to-part ratios because you are
comparing the individual quantities. The comparisons in the second column are
part-to-whole ratios because you are comparing one of the parts to the total number
of parts.

<Scenario>
Suppose Mr. Raith needs 2 parts blue paint and 5 parts yellow paint to make
green paint.
</Scenario>

1. Compare the quantities of blue and yellow paint in Mr. Raith‘s mixture by writing all
possible ratios for each type. 

<Table
    rows={[
        ['a. Part-to-part ratios', 'b. Part-to-whole ratios'],
        ['What is the difference between the part-to-part ratios that you wrote?', 
        'What is the difference between the part-to-whole ratios that you wrote?'],
    ]}
/>


# session 3 title: "Ratio Hunt"

You can find ratios all around you, even in your classroom! Just consider two different quantities. For example, how many students in your class wear glasses? How many students don’t wear glasses?
1. Write a ratio to describe each given relationship.

<Table
    headers={['Part-to-part ratios', 'Part-to-whole ratios']}
    rows={[
        ['a. The number of students wearing glasses to the number of students not wearing glasses', 'b. The number of students wearing glasses to the total number of students'],
        ['c. The number of students not wearing glasses to the number of students wearing glasses', 
        'd. The number of students not wearing glasses to the total number of studentsWhat is the difference between the part-to-whole ratios that you wrote?'],
    ]}
/>


Let's go on a Ratio Hunt!

2. Search around your classroom for at least two pairs of quantities to compare.
For each pair:
- Identify the two quantities that you are comparing.
- Write all possible part-to-part and/or part-to-whole comparisons of the quantities.
- Identify each ratio as part-to-part or as part-to-whole.
- Be prepared to share your treasures from the Ratio Hunt with the class.

<Table
    rows={[
        ['a. Quantities being compared:', 'b. Quantities being compared:'],
        ['Ratio(s):', 'Ratio(s):'],
    ]}
/>



# session 4 title: "Making Sense of Ratios"

In this activity, you will represent ratios in different ways.
<Scenario>
The Lanterton Middle School is adopting a new nickname. They have narrowed their search to the following two names: **Tigers** or **Lions**. To choose a nickname, they conducted a school-wide survey and tallied all the votes.
</Scenario>
Each homeroom analyzed the results of the school-wide survey and reported the results
in a different way.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**School-Wide Survey Results**</div>
<Table
    rows={[
        ['Homeroom 6A', 'Homeroom 6B'],
        ['The votes for Tigers outnumbered the votes for Lions by a ratio of 240 to 160.','There were 80 more votes for Tigers than Lions.'],
        ['Homeroom 7A', 'Homeroom 7B'],
        ['The votes for Tigers outnumbered votes for Lions by a ratio of 3 to 2.', '3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.'] 
    ]}
    textAlign="center"
/>

1. Describe the meaning of each statement. Then, identify which describe ratios and if
so, whether the ratios are part-to-part or part-to-whole ratios.
<Scenario variant="workedExample">
Let’s consider the results reported by Homeroom 7A: “The votes for Tigers outnumbered votes for Lions by
a ratio of 3 to 2.”
This comparison is an example of a part-to-part ratio expressed in words. There are two other ways you can express this part-to-part ratio.

**With a Colon**<div></div>
3 votes for Tigers : 2 votes for Lions<div></div>
**In Fractional Form**
<div style={{ display: 'inline-block', textAlign: 'center', lineHeight: '1.2' }}>
  <span>3 votes for Tigers</span>
  <hr style={{ border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid black', margin: '5px 0' }} />
  <span>2 votes for Lions</span>
</div>
</Scenario>

Next, let’s consider the results of the student vote as reported by
Homeroom 7B: “3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.”

2. Complete the part-to-part and part-to-whole ratios written in words. Then, write each
ratio with a colon and in fractional form. **Label all quantities.**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Part Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes for Tigers for every 2 votes for Lions', '', ''],
    ['2 votes for Lions for every (  ) votes for Tigers', '', '']
  ]}
/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Whole Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.', '', ''],
    ['(  ) out of 5 votes were for Lions.', '', '']
  ]}
/>

Finally, let’s consider the results of the survey as reported by Homeroom 6A: “The votes
for Tigers outnumbered the votes for Lions by a ratio of 240 to 160.”

3. Complete the part-to-part and part-to-whole ratios written in words. Then, write each
ratio with a colon and in fractional form. **Label all quantities.**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Part Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes for Tigers,  (  ) votes for Lions', '', ''],
    ['(  ) votes for Lions,  (  ) votes for Tigers', '', '']
  ]}
/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Whole Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true} 
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes out of (  ) votes were for Tigers.', '', ''],
    ['(  ) votes out of (  ) votes were for Lions.', '', '']
  ]}
/>

4. Based on the survey, which mascot name did the students prefer?
<QuestionInputProps />


# session 5 title: "Special Types of Ratios"

Consider each statement:
- There is an 80 percent chance of rain tomorrow.
- Diego always gives 110%.
- Your battery is 50% charged.
- Joe received a 90% on a 10-question quiz.<div></div>

Each situation describes a special type of ratio called a percent. A **percent** is a part-to-whole ratio where the whole is equal to 100.
- Percent is another name for hundredths.
- The percent symbol “%” means “per 100,” or “out of 100.”

<Scenario variant="workedExample" imgSrc="/images/module-1/chapter-1/section-5/act5-1.png">

35% means 35 out of 100.<div></div>

**You can shade 35 of the 100 squares on the hundredths grid to represent 35%.**

</Scenario>

Write a fraction and a percent to represent the shaded part of each grid.<div></div>
Each hundredths grid represents a whole.

# session 6 title: "Writing and Classifying Ratios"

There are several ways to compare two quantities and write ratios.

<Image

1. Consider the statement: There are n sixth-grade band members and t total
sixth-graders.

<QuestionInputProps question="a. Write a part-to-whole ratio using colon notation."
></QuestionInputProps>

<QuestionInputProps question="b. Write a part-to-part ratio using colon notation."
></QuestionInputProps>

2. A survey of sixth-graders with pets revealed that c students prefer cats and
d students prefer dogs.

<QuestionInputProps question="a. How would you compare these two statements using part-to-part ratios?"
></QuestionInputProps>

<QuestionInputProps question="b. How would you compare these two statements using part-to-whole ratios?"
></QuestionInputProps>

# session 7 title: Assignment

### JOURNAL
Describe two ratios in the real world. Write about at least one part-to-whole ratio and one part-to-part ratio.

<Scenario variant="remember">
A ratio is a comparison of two quantities using division.<div></div>
A part-to-whole ratio compares a part of a whole to the total number of parts.<div></div>
A part-to-part ratio compares parts.<div></div>
A percent is a part-to-whole ratio where the whole is 100.<div></div>

</Scenario>

### PRACTICE
The Lewis brothers joined a club that provides them with free movies based on a list that they pre-select. The boys pick the first 10 movies for their list by choosing their favorite type of movie. John David puts 5 sports movies on the list; Parker chooses 3 sci-fi movies; and Stephen adds 2 comedies.

1. Write the ratio in colon and in fractional form to express each relationship.

<Table
