## Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age

Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from the simple question of what to have for breakfast to more complex choices like whether to double major. Our response to these decisions depends on the information we have available at any given moment. We rarely have the data we need to make perfect decisions, we are faced with what economists call “imperfect information,” but we still make hundreds of decisions a day.

Now we have another avenue to gather information—social media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering how we make choices, how we spend our time, which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university without first checking its social media presence for information and feedback? As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information disseminates through channels like social media.

This chapter is an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior in markets—the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s end—to “bring home” the concepts in play.

## Introduction

What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After all, there are other disciplines you could be studying and other ways you could be spending your time. Making choices is at the heart of what economists study, and your decision to take this course is as much an economic decision as anything else.

Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.
