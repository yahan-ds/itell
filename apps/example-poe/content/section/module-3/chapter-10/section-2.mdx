  To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what
  determines total supply or total demand for the economy and how the two
  interact at the macroeconomic level.
</Callout>

We call this the **aggregate demand/aggregate supply model**. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.

## The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP

Firms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, that they need to buy.

<Warning title="The aggregate supply (AS) curve">
  shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and
  sell at each price level.

**Figure 10.2** shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at a time: the **horizontal and vertical axes**, the **aggregate supply curve** itself, and the meaning of the **potential GDP** vertical line.

**Figure 10.2** The Aggregate Supply Curve

Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.

The diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP—that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In other words, the price level in the AD/AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in **The Macroeconomic Perspective**. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. We visualize the price level as an index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price level over time.

As the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price level on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or outputs bought in the economy—i.e. the GDP deflator—not the price level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an increase in aggregate demand.

An AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below **potential GDP**, which we define as the amount of real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell—while assuming no rise in input prices—can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.

As the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the AS curve's intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to encourage a greater quantity of output—but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be as large. (Read the following section to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)

### Why does AS cross potential GDP?

Economists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling:

<Callout>
  How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its
  “potential” or “full employment” GDP?
</Callout>

The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.

At the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are fully employed. In **Figure 10.2**, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called **full-employment GDP**.

### Defining SRAS and LRAS

The AS curve shows short run changes in aggregate supply, while the vertical line at potential GDP shows long run changes in aggregate supply. In the short run, if demand is too low or too high, it is possible for producers to supply less or more than potential GDP. In the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the **short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve**. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as the **long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve**.

The long-run aggregate supply curve is actually pretty simple: it's a vertical line showing an economy's potential growth rates. Combining the long-run aggregate supply curve with the aggregate demand curve can help us understand business fluctuations.

## The Aggregate Demand Curve

**Aggregate demand (AD)** refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We explained this distinction in the previous chapter on **The Expenditure-Output Model**. For now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.

Aggregate demand includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the price level—recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy. The **aggregate demand (AD) curve** shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level.

  **Figure 10.3** The Aggregate Demand Curve
</Image>

**Figure 10.3** presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level.

The AD curve slopes down, which means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand:

- consumption spending (C)

- investment spending (I)

- government spending (G)

- spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): $C + I + G + X - M$.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="Wealth Effect">
    The **wealth effect** holds that as the price level increases, the buying
    power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts and other
    assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise
    in the price level reduces people's wealth, consumption spending will fall
    as the price level rises.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Interest Rate Effect">
    The **interest rate effect** holds that as prices for outputs rise, the same
    purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This additional
    demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher
    interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes
    and reduce borrowing by households for homes and cars—thus reducing
    consumption and investment spending.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Foreign Price Effect">
    The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States
    while remaining fixed in other countries, then goods in the United States
    will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the
    world. U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of
    exports sold will fall. U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper,
    so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level,
    relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export
    expenditures.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

Among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in **Figure 10.3** slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not very large.

    Is Xurbia risking inflationary pressures or facing high unemployment? How can
    you tell?

    Determine where $AD$ and $AS$ intersect. This is the equilibrium with the price level at 130 and real GDP at \$680.

    ####

    Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the $AS$ curve becomes quite steep, almost vertical, which seems to start at about \$750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively flat part of the $AS$ curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are likely to be small.

    ####

    Determine what the steep portion of the $AS$ curve indicates. Where the $AS$ curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential GDP.

- If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then the economy is not close to potential GDP. It will be experiencing unemployment, but have stable price levels.

- If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP. It will be experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.

## Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price level rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.

<Image alt='The graph shows a downward sloping aggregate demand curve that intersects with an upward sloping aggregate supply curve at the point (8,800, 90).' src='/images/module-3/chapter-10/section-2/bc741c2489f992f46d5e3fe2804dd440ba4e5521.png'>
**Figure 10.5** Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand

</Image>

**Figure 10.5** combines the AS curve from Figure 10.2 and the AD curve from **Figure 10.3** and places them both on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.

Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital. Read the following section to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.

### Are AS and AD macro or micro?

The aggregate supply/demand model has a superficial resemblance to the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital, but the two approaches also have many underlying differences.

1. **The vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams.** The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared with the prices of other products, e.g. the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken. In contrast, the vertical axis of an aggregate supply/aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator, combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is the average price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a specific market.
2. **The economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models.** Demand curves for individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram, as we shall see in later chapters, though, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the AS curve.

In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.
