    - Identify the neoclassical zone, the intermediate zone, and the Keynesian zone in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

    - Use an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a diagnostic test to understand the current state of the economy

</Info>

We can use the AD/AS model to illustrate both Say's law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes' law that demand creates its own supply. Consider the SRAS curve's three zones which **Figure 10.11** identifies: the **Keynesian zone**, the **neoclassical zone**, and the **intermediate zone**.

The Keynesian is furthest to the left as well as the lowest; the intermediate zone is the center of the three curves; the neoclassical zone is the furthest to the right as well as the highest."

  Supply Curve

Near the equilibrium Ek, in the **Keynesian zone** at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD to the right or the left will affect the output level Yk, but will not affect the price level much. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity of output.

Near the equilibrium En, in the **neoclassical zone** at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD the right or the left will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP largely determines the quantity of output.

In the **intermediate zone** around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.

    <TabPanel value="Keynesian Zone">
      The **Keynesian zone** is the portion of the SRAS curve on the far left
      which is relatively flat. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS
      curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then the equilibrium level of real
      GDP is far below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical
      unemployment is high. If AD shifts to the right or left in the Keynesian
      zone, it will determine the resulting level of output, and thus
      unemployment. However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry
      in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not vary much in this
      zone.
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel value="Neoclassical Zone">
      The **neoclassical zone** of the SRAS curve is the near-vertical portion
      on the right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS
      curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential
      GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of
      output in the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP,
      cyclical unemployment is low in this economy, although structural
      unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of AD
      to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or
      employment. The only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the
      neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD
      in the neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.

    <TabPanel value="Intermediate Zone">
      Finally, the SRAS curve's **intermediate zone** lies between the Keynesian
      zone and the neoclassical zone in Figure 11.11. If the AD curve crosses
      this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we
      might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions.
      For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to
      potential GDP and thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher
      price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to
      the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise
      unemployment, but will also lead to a lower price level and downward
      pressure on inflation.

This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This will clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. **The Keynesian Perspective** and **The Neoclassical Perspective** should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the macroeconomy.

### From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust

We can explain economic fluctuations, whether those experienced during the 1930s Great Depression, the 1970s stagflation, or the 2008-2009 Great Recession, using the AD/AS diagram. Short-run fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD curve, or both.

In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values continued to rise, the increased value would pay off any debt outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and economic growth in the United States.

When the housing bubble burst, overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This drop in home values was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its contagion into the financial market that essentially locked up new credit. The AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the Great Recession's rising unemployment.

  Understanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided monetary
  and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions to take to
  mitigate the impact of the housing crisis.

From a monetary policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts, and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.

While most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations. We discuss the possible policy actions and the differences among economists about their effectiveness in more detail in **The Keynesian Perspective, Monetary Policy** and **Bank Regulation, and Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy**.
