The AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals of growth, unemployment, and low inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both Keynes' law, which focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, and Say's law, which focuses on aggregate supply and the long run.

These advantages of the AD/AS model are considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.

## Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram

In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the full employment level of GDP) will gradually shift to the right over time as well.

Earlier, **Figure 10.7 (a)** showed a pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year. However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.

  In the short run, GDP falls and rises as every economy dips into or expands
  out of recession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the
  equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as we see
  at the equilibrium point E0 in **Figure 10.9**. From another standpoint, in
  years of resurgent economic growth, the equilibrium will typically be close to
  potential GDP, as equilibrium point E1 in **Figure 11.9** shows.

The higher of the two aggregate demand curves is closer to the vertical potential GDP line and hence represents an economy with a low unemployment. In contrast, the lower aggregate demand curve is much further from the potential GDP line and hence represents an economy that may be struggling with a recession."

### Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram

The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP employment level. Returning to **Figure 10.9**, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E1. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E0. Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.

## Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram

Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms. The biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century, for example, followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II.

Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative—a situation called “deflation”—during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007-2009, the inflation rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to -0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid-1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend of being substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1-5% range annually.

The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. In **Figure 10.10 (a)**, aggregate demand shifts to the right. The new equilibrium E1 is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E0. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed. In this case, additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.

(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from $A_{D0}$ to $A_{D1}$, when it happens in the
area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher
price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new
equilibrium ($E_1$) is at a higher price level ($P_1$) than the original
equilibrium.
</Column>

<Column>
(b) A shift in aggregate supply, from $\text{SRAS}_0$ to $\text{SRAS}_1$, will lead to a lower
real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new
equilibrium ($E_1$) is at a higher price level ($P_1$), while the original
equilibrium ($E_0$) is at the lower price level ($P_0$).

An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor. These higher price levels cause the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In **Figure 10.10 (b)**, the SRAS curve's shift to the left also increases the price level from P0 at the original equilibrium (E0) to a higher price level of P1 at the new equilibrium (E1). In effect, the rise in input prices results in a higher price level for outputs after the final output is produced and sold.

The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these expectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation expected.

These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.

## Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

- Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts, including:

- The three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment

- The four elements of aggregate demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports

- Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs

- Economic events and policy decisions that can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.
