    - Evaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists react to recessions

    - Analyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and Keynesian economic models

    We can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and neoclassical models
    to the challenge of riding two horses simultaneously.

    When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of
    the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two.

As modern macroeconomists ride into the future on two horses—with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical perspective—the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses and tells us something different about the macroeconomy.

      The short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate
      demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price
      rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical
      unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run aggregate
      demand adjustments, Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long-term
      causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exist
      even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.

      The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on
      the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus
      tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.
      However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why
      unemployment moves up and down over short periods of a few years, nor is
      it especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and
      long-lasting recession, like the 1930s Great Depression. Keynesian
      economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid
      for lower unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as
      a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment.

Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way:

<Blockquote author="Robert Solow">
  At short time scales, I think, something sort of "Keynesian" is a good
  approximation, and surely better than anything straight "neoclassical". At
  very long time scales, the interesting questions are best studied in a
  neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be
  a minor distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece
  things together as best we can, and look for a hybrid

Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.

## Navigating Unchartered Waters

Were the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective? Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees.

Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics found that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than 3.3% in 2008 followed by 0.1% in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler.

Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect? that once the government implemented policies, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.

The difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the stabilization policies that the government took in response to the Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened had the government not implemented those policies. Surely some of the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while other programs were less so. The conclusion on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the U.S. dollar's value in the financial market.
