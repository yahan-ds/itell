The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the **Keynesian cross diagram**, determines the equilibrium level of real GDP at the point where _the total or aggregate expenditures_ in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced. The aggregate expenditures in the economy consist of total spending on consumption, investment, government spending and net exports. The four components of the aggregate expenditures are the same components we covered in the chapter on GDP and the Expenditure Approach of measuring the GPD.

The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in **Figure 9.2** show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending. Both axes are measured in real (inflation- adjusted) terms.

- The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis.

- A vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs.

- The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal.

- The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises.

- The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium.

- Equilibrium occurs at E0, where aggregate expenditure AE0 is equal to the output level Y0.

Remember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, managers, and investors and owners of firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income (Y). Sometimes, it is useful to refer to real GDP as “national income,” as in the graph above.

## The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line

### First Conceptual Line: Potential GDP

The first conceptual line is a vertical line showing the level of **potential GDP**. Potential GDP refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of both its labor and physical capital. We discuss potential GDP in much more detail in **Chapter 9 The Aggregate Demand/ Aggregate Supply Model**.

### Second Conceptual Line: The 45-Degree Line

The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.

### Macroeconomic Equilibrium

When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP. By definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which can only occur along the 45-degree line.

### The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which shows the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line—at point E0 in **Figure 9.2**—will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how to interpret it.
