title: Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

## Overview

<Info title='By the end of this section, you will be able to:'>

- Describe and explain how each component of the Aggregate Expenditures responds to the changes in national income: Consumption, Investment, Government Spending, Net Exports

</Info>

**Aggregate expenditure** is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises.

Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line, —(1) consumption, (2) investment, (3) government spending, (4) exports and imports or net exports.

<Callout>
  The key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national
  income rises.
</Callout>

## Consumption as a Function of National Income

<Callout>
  How do consumption expenditures (C) increase as national income rises?
</Callout>

People can do two things with their income: consume it or save it. Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice.

- The **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)**, is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures.

- The **marginal propensity to save (MPS)** is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save.

It must always hold true that:

$$
\text{MPC} + \text{MPS} = 1
$$

For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.

### Changes in Consumption (and Savings) as National Incomes Increases

With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown on the consumption function in **Figure 9.8** below.

<Warning>
  Note that we use “Aggregate Expenditure” on the vertical axis in this and the
  following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate
  expenditures. An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income
  were zero, people would have to consume something. For an intuitive example,
  consider non-working full-time college students with zero income, but who
  still have to consume a bundle of goods in order to sustain themselves.

In the example in **Figure 9.8**, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Economists call this number the intercept of the consumption function and the vertical axis **autonomous consumption** or **autonomous expenditure**.

Autonomous consumption/expenditure is the portion of the expenditure or spending that is not related to current income.

When consumption is at \$600 as shown in **Figure 9.8**, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by \$1,000, consumption rises by \$800 and savings rise by \$200. Because both of these changes are result of changes in income first, we call them **induced consumption / expenditure and savings**.

At an income of \$4,000, total consumption will be the \$600 even without any income, plus \$4,000 multiplied by the MPC of 0.8, or \$3,200, for a total of \$3,800.

The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical. This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in **Figure 9.8** and **Table 9.1**, is called the **consumption function**.

<Callout>
  In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level
  of national income?
</Callout>

- Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy.

- At a national income level of zero, \$600 is consumed and -\$600 is saved (or “**dissaved**”).

- Each time income rises by \$1,000, consumption and savings rise by \$800 and \$200, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume and save are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.

The pattern of consumption shown in **Table 9.1** is plotted in **Figure 9.8**:

- To calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add \$600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero.

- To calculate savings, multiply the income level by 0.2, for the marginal propensity to save, and add negative \$600, for the amount that would be saved even if income was zero.

- Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.

| Income | Consumption | Savings |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| $0     | $600        | -$600   |
| $1,000 | $1,400      | -$400   |
| $2,000 | $2,200      | -$200   |
| $3,000 | $3,000      | $0      |
| $4,000 | $3,800      | $200    |
| $5,000 | $4,600      | $400    |
| $6,000 | $5,400      | $600    |
| $7,000 | $6,200      | $800    |
| $8,000 | $7,000      | $1,000  |
| $9,000 | $7,800      | $1,200  |

To illustrate these relationships further, consider the examples in **Table 9.2** and **Figure 9.9**.

### Saving

Saving is income not spent to finance consumption. **Figure 9.9** (a) shows that when income (Y) is zero, saving is - C0. In other words, households are not borrowing or selling their assets. Because just a fraction c of any change in income is spent on consumption, the remaining fraction or (1 - c) of any change in income is saved. The marginal propensity to save

$\text{MPS} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$ is $(1 - c)$. Accordingly, a change in income changes planned consumption and planned saving, and MPC + MPS = 1.

**Figure 9.10** shows the saving function corresponding to the consumption function in **Figure 9.9**.

<Image
  alt="Figure 9.10 The Saving Function. The graph shows two images. The left image shows the saving function in the form of an image with Real GDP on the horizontal axis and Saving on the vertical axis. The right image is an example with values, S = -20 + 0.2Y"

  Figure 9.10 The Saving Function
</Image>

Based on the above consumption function and the absence of government and foreign sectors, households can either spend income on consumption or save it. This means Y = C + S, and S = Y - C so the saving function shown in **Figure 9.10** is:

$$
S = -C_0 + (1 - c) Y
$$

Adding $C = C0 + cY$ and $S = -C0 + (1 - c)Y$, the left-hand side gives consumption plus saving or $C + S$, and the right-hand side gives income,

$$
Y = C_0 + cY +( -C_0 + (1 - c)Y)
$$

as it should.

## Movements Along vs. Shifts in Consumption and Savings Functions

When using diagrams, we make an important distinction between events that **move the economy along** the consumption and saving functions as opposed to events that **shift the consumption and saving functions**

<Columns>
<Column>
#### Movement Along Consumption and Savings Functions

A change in income causes a **movement along the consumption and saving functions**. The changes in consumption expenditure and saving are determined by the MPC and the MPS. These are changes in expenditure and saving plans induced by changes in income.

</Column>
<Column>
#### Shifts in Consumption and Savings Functions

Any change other than a change in income that affects consumption and saving at every income level causes a **shift in the consumption and saving functions**. These changes in expenditure and saving plans are autonomous, caused by something other than changes in income.

</Column>
</Columns>

The economic crisis and recession of 2008-2009 is explained in part by shifts in household consumption expenditure caused by changes in confidence and expectations about the future of the economy. Consumers watched as banks and financial institutions collapsed in many countries. Pessimism and uncertainty about households' income and finances increased with losses in household financial wealth as equity markets declined sharply on an international scale. In addition, the housing bubble collapse in the United States caused households to cut back, reducing autonomous expenditure.

Even in relatively tranquil economic times, increases in household indebtedness, changes in demographics, or changes in government monetary and fiscal policies will change autonomous consumption and shift the consumption function.

### Changing Slopes of Consumption and Savings Functions

We also identify a limited number of changes in the economy that will affect the slopes of the consumption and saving functions. For instance, a change in household preferences for saving that reduces the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption. These events are of special interest because the slope of the consumption function—and the household expenditure behavior it describes—is the key to our understanding of fluctuations in real output.

## Investment as a Function of National Income

Investment (I) decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do not depend on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.

**Figure 9.11** shows an investment function where the level of investment is set at a level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.

<Image
  alt="Figure 9.11 The Investment Function. The graph shows a straight, horizontal line at 500 on the y-axis, representative of the investment function."
  src="/images/module-3/chapter-9/section-2/HzpAO8wbfScEIFgf_PvngCxC00-wmPEN_.jpg"
>
  **Figure 9.11** The Investment Function
</Image>

The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and it therefore does not change with the level of current national income.

In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.

The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that affect investment—new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment—can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up, indicating an increase in the level of investments, or down, indicating the decrease in investments.

## Government Spending as a Function of National Income

<Image

>
  **Figure 9.12** The Government Spending Function
</Image>

In the Keynesian cross diagram, **government spending** (G) appears as a horizontal line just like the investments function. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.

- The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300.

- Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.

## Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function

All the components of aggregate expenditure—consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and the trade balance (or net exports, NX, or X-M)—are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. The same components also form aggregate demand, which we will explore in the next chapter.

**Figure 9.15** builds an aggregate expenditure function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text.

- Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax consumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed.

- The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of \$6,000.

- Potential GDP in this example is \$7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.

| National Income | After-Tax Income | Consumption | Government Spending + Investment + Exports | Imports | Aggregate Expenditure |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------- |
| $3,000          | $2,100           | $2,280      | $2,640                                     | $300    | $4,620                |
| $4,000          | $2,800           | $2,840      | $2,640                                     | $400    | $5,080                |
| $5,000          | $3,500           | $3,400      | $2,640                                     | $500    | $5,540                |
| $6,000          | $4,200           | $3,960      | $2,640                                     | $600    | $6,000                |
| $7,000          | $4,900           | $4,520      | $2,640                                     | $700    | $6,460                |
| $8,000          | $5,600           | $5,080      | $2,640                                     | $800    | $6,920                |
| $9,000          | $6,300           | $5,640      | $2,640                                     | $900    | $7,380                |

<Caption>
  **Table 9.3** below shows how to bring taxes into the consumption function.
</Caption>

- The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram.

- The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes.

- The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by \$700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by \$560 (700 x 0.8) from one row to the next.

- The fourth column shows investment, government, spending, and exports, which do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was \$500, government spending was \$1,300, and exports were \$840, for a total of \$2,640.

- The fifth column shows the level of imports, which are calculated as 0.1 of real GDP in this example.

- The final column, aggregate expenditures, sums up $C + I + G + X - M$. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in **Figure 9.15**.

The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking the consumption function (after taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import function on top of one another. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures, which do not vary with national income.

The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function is determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, tax rate, and marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter, because out of any extra income, more goes to savings, taxes, or imports and less goes to spending on domestic goods and services.

The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.
