The Great Depression "was a period of protests and hunger marches — and unionism spread like wildfire — but many people suffered quietly, ashamed of their poverty.

No matter what their situation, the Great Depression changed those in the generation that survived it".

## The Great Depression

The personal suffering that families faced during the Great Depression of the 1930s is less apparent when we look at the **Figure 9.1**, but it still reveals the extraordinary nature of the economy at the time. The graph shows real gross domestic product (real GDP) in the United States from 1890 to 1939.

Three things stand out, with the third being the most important for this chapter.

1. Although the level of US economic activity grew substantially over this half century, there were many ups and downs in the economy during the late 19th century and early 20th century.

2. The period from 1929 to 1937 stands out from the rest. This was not a minor blip in economic activity; the US economy suffered a collapse that persisted for many years. At the same time, unemployment climbed to a staggering 25 percent in 1933. One out of four people was unemployed, compared to a rate of only 3.2 percent in 1929.

## Introduction

From the Great Depression in the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained using the Aggregate Expenditure - Aggregate Output, or Expenditure-Output model. This approach is strongly rooted in the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending (hence, “expenditure-output model”) in the economy, with no explicit mention of other fundamental factors such as aggregate supply or price level. Despite this lack of explicit discussion within the basic model, it is possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the model.
