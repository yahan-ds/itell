The Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand and argues that firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation's potential GDP, the amount of goods and services that actually sell, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists across the economy. **Figure 11.2** illustrates this point.

The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.

Keynes argued that aggregate demand is not stable—that it can change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P0 and Yp. Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment, as Y1 in **Figure 11.2** shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.

In the same way, if AD increases, the economy could experience an inflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output.

## What Determines Consumption Expenditure?

We call spending on new capital goods investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:

1. Producer's durable equipment and software

2. Changes in inventories

3. Nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations)

4. Residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings)

Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the last.

Keynes's treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both the expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).

The clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits. When we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.

Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, businesses need financing when they purchase big-ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.

Many factors can affect the expected profitability of an investment. For example, if energy prices decline, then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If the government offers special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if the government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand.

## What Determines Investment Expenditure?

Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries—once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from **The Macroeconomic Perspective** that services are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.

Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="Disposable income">
    For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they
    consume is how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as
    disposable income, which is income after taxes.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Expected future income">
    Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining
    consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more
    likely to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of recession and
    troubles in the economy will make them pull back on consumption.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Wealth">
    When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume
    a higher share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market
    rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for example, U.S. savings rates
    declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had
    increased and there was less need to save. People spend beyond their income
    by borrowing when they perceive their wealth increasing. On the other hand,
    when the U.S. stock market declined about 40% from March 2008 to March 2009,
    people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so savings
    rates increased while consumption declined.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the right.

## What Determines Government Spending?

The third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities and Positive Externalities and Public Goods, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.

Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or raising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending.

<Warning>
  Keynes concluded that during extreme times like deep recessions, only the
  government had the power and resources to move aggregate demand.

## What Determines Net Exports?

Recall that exports are domestically produced products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.

Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand:

1. changes in relative growth rates between countries

2. changes in related prices between countries

What happens in the economies of the countries that would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example, if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the level of income in the domestic economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: More income will bring a higher level of imports.

Relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S. goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.

**Table 11.1** summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand.
