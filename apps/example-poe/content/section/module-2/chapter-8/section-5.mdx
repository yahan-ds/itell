- Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation

- Identify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy

</Info>

When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, economists use the term **indexed**. An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. Those in private markets and government programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another—say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive—indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.

## Indexing in Private Markets

There are three types of indexing that occur in private markets: cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARM), and business contracts that have automatic adjustments for inflation.

  <AccordionItem value="Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs)">
    In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that
    had cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) which guaranteed that their wages
    would keep up with inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for
    example, “COLA plus 3%.” Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would
    automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would
    automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to wages.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan (ARM)">
    Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the
    inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then the interest rate that a
    financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points as
    well. An adjustable- rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan that one can use
    to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of
    inflation. Often, a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if
    borrowing with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that
    with an ARM, the lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation
    will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the
    interest rate can be correspondingly lower.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="Business Contracts with Automatic Adjustments for Inflation">
    Many ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that
    prices will adjust automatically according to inflation. Sellers like such
    contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if
    inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts because
    they are not locked into a high buying price if inflation turns out to be
    lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for inflation in
    effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather than a nominal
    price.

### Indexing in Government Programs

Many government programs are indexed to inflation, including the U.S. income tax code, the U.S. Social Security program, and indexed bonds.

<Accordion>
    <AccordionItem value='U. S. Income Tax Code'>
        The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person's income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. This is what the expression “move into a higher tax bracket” means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2017 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from \$0 to \$9,325; 15% of all income from \$9,326 to \$37,950; 25% of all taxable income from \$37,951 to \$91,900; 28% of all taxable income from \$91,901 to \$191,650; 33% of all taxable income from \$191,651 to \$416,700; 35% of all taxable income from \$416,701 to \$418,400; and 39.6% of all income from \$418,401 and above.

        Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine the exact amount of taxes an individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this “bracket creep”. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.

    <AccordionItem value='Social Security'>
        The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the benefit level.
    </AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItem value='Indexed Bonds'>
        As another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S. government began offering indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation—no matter the level of inflation—can be a very comforting investment.

## Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?

Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of inflation.

However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it most.

### A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?

As we will learn in **Money and Banking**, the existence of money provides enormous benefits to an economy. Money is what greases the gears of markets. It makes transactions easier. It allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the money earned to purchase the other products they need to live.

Too much money in circulation, however, can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy reverts to barter, or it adopts another country's more stable currency, like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.

Only national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation. Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The only option is to print money—more and more of it. With more money in circulation chasing the same amount (or even fewer) goods and services, the only result is increasingly higher prices until the economy and/or the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of letting inflation spiral out of control.
