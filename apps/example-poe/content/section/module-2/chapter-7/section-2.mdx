Let's look at how unemployment rates have changed over time and how various groups of people are affected by unemployment differently.

## The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate

**Figure 7.2** shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment since 1955. The U.S. unemployment rate moves up and down as the economy moves in and out of recessions. However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of 4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower.

As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:

1. Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007-2009, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.

2. Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006-2007, and 5% or slightly less from September 2015 through January 2017 (the latest date for which data are available as of this writing). The previous time unemployment had been less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.

3. The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%—and it stays that low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)

The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity, and especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods of recession and depression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.

No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324 million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2017. However, despite the increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.

## Unemployment Rates by Group

Unemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. **Figure 7.3** shows unemployment rates broken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

### Unemployment Rates by Gender

  alt="figure7.3a. Graph a shows the trends in unemployment rates by gender for the year 1972 to 2014. In 1972 the graph starts out at 6.6% for females. It jumps to 9.3% in 1975 for females, gradually goes back down until 2009, when it rises to 8.1%. It gradually lowers to 6.1% in 2014 for females. For males, it starts out at  around 5% in 1972, goes up and down periodically, and ends at 6.3% in 2014.  "

Unemployment rates for men used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close, with the unemployment rate for men somewhat higher, especially during and soon after the Great Recession.

The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as “secondary” earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men. During the 2008-2009 recession and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the unemployment rate for women. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed.

### Unemployment Rates by Ages

<Image
  alt="figure7.3b. Graph b shows the trends in unemployment rates for women, by age for the year 1972 to 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out around 9% for women aged 20-24, goes up to 13.6% in 1975, and ends at 11.2% in 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out at 3.7% for women aged 25-54, jumps to 6.4% in 1975, and ends at around 5% in 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out around 3% for women aged 55 and over. It remains between 3-5% until 2010, when it jumps to 7%. In 2014, it drops down to 4.4%."

Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process of matching workers with jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics.

### Unemployment Rates by Race and Ethnicity

  alt="figure7.3c. Graph c shows the trends in unemployment rates by race and ethnicity for the year 1972 to 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out at 10.4% for Blacks, rises to nearly 15% in 1975, rises even more in 1983 to 19.5%, and ends up around 11% in 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out around 7% for Hispanics, rises to around 12% in 1975, and ends at 7.4% in 2014. In 1972, the graph starts out around 5% for Whites, jumps to nearly 8% in 1975, jumps again to nearly 8.5% in 1982, and ends up at around 5% in 2014."

Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate for black workers is typically about twice as high as that for whites, while the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers is in between.

Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In January 2017, for example, the unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.5%; for those with some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate was 3.8%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the unemployment rate was 5.3%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 7.7%. This pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and higher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities like lower pay for low-skilled workers compared to the opportunities for more highly-skilled workers, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to find jobs.

## Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways

<Callout>
  The Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for
  unemployment, as well as the length of time individuals have been unemployed.
</Callout>

**Table 7.2**, for example, shows the four reasons for unemployment and the percentages of the currently unemployed that fall into each category. **Table 7.3** shows the length of unemployment. For both of these data sets, the information is from January 2017.

| Reason                    | Percentage |
| ------------------------- | ---------- |
| New Entrants              | 10.8%      |
| Re-entrants               | 28.7%      |
| Job Leavers               | 11.4%      |
| Job Losers: Temporary     | 14.0%      |
| Job Losers: Non Temporary | 35.1%      |

<Caption>**Table 7.2** Reasons for Unemployment, January 2017</Caption>

| Length of Time | Percentage |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Under 5 weeks  | 32.5%      |
| 5 to 14 weeks  | 27.5%      |
| 15 to 26 weeks | 15.7%      |

### International Unemployment Comparisons

From an international perspective, the U.S. unemployment rate typically has looked a little better than average. **Table 8.4** compares unemployment rates for 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 (just before the recession), and 2012 (somewhat after the recession) from several other high-income countries.

| Country        | 1991 | 1996  | 2001 | 2006  | 2012  |
| -------------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| United States  | 6.8% | 5.4%  | 4.8% | 4.4%  | 8.1%  |
| Canada         | 9.8% | 8.8%  | 6.4% | 6.2%  | 6.3%  |
| Japan          | 2.1% | 3.4%  | 5.1% | 4.5%  | 3.9%  |
| France         | 9.5% | 12.5% | 8.7% | 10.1% | 10.0% |
| Germany        | 5.6% | 9.0%  | 8.9% | 9.8%  | 5.5%  |
| Italy          | 6.9% | 11.7% | 9.6% | 7.8%  | 10.8% |
| Sweden         | 3.1% | 9.9%  | 5.0% | 5.2%  | 7.9%  |
| United Kingdom | 8.8% | 8.1%  | 5.1% | 5.5%  | 8.0%  |

However, we need to treat cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates with care, because each country has slightly different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for measuring unemployment, and also different labor markets. For example, Japan's unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan's economy has been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan's unemployment rate probably paints too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced hours or officially employed despite doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual method to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.

Comparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Census Bureau. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low-income countries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and food assistance. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than in high-income countries.

We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. [Learn more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-26/divining-unemployment-in-china)
