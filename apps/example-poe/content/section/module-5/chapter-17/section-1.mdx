Most countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger neighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to **dollarize**—that is, to use the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common currency is the decision by 17 European nations—including some very large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy—to replace their former currencies with the euro.

With these exceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring, borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency the **foreign exchange market**.

## The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets

The quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking. A 2013 Bank of International Settlements survey found that \$5.3 trillion _per day_ was traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was \$15.8 trillion _per year_.

**Table 17.1** shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The U.S. dollar dominates the foreign exchange market, followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.

| Currency          | % Daily Share |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| U.S. dollar       | 87.6%         |
| Euro              | 31.3%         |
| Japanese yen      | 21.6%         |
| British pound     | 12.8%         |
| Australian dollar | 6.9%          |
| Canadian dollar   | 5.1%          |
| Swiss franc       | 4.8%          |
| Chinese yuan      | 2.6%          |

## Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets

In foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency—and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market:

- (1) Firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services

- (2) Tourists visiting other countries

- (3) International investors buying ownership (or part- ownership) of a foreign firm (Foreign Direct Investment)

- (4) International investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership (Portfolio Investment)

Let's consider these categories in turn.

Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm exporting abroad will earn some other currency—say, U.S. dollars—but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.

International tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.

We often divide financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency into two categories.

**Foreign direct investment (FDI)** refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase, InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.

**Portfolio investment**, the other kind of international financial investment, involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.

Business people often link portfolio investment to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For simplicity, ignore any bond interest payment (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British pound is currently worth \$1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth \$1.60 in U.S. currency.

<Image alt='The chart shows the chain of events that investors would hope for based on whether or not they believed currency would appreciate or depreciate.' src='/images/module-5/chapter-17/section-1/8dff9e76cf5b11ca54f44ae289ba028eca75573b.png' width={700} height={500}>

**Figure 17.1** Figure 17.1 A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements

</Image>

Thus, as **Figure 17.1 (a)** shows, this investor would change \$24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth \$1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have \$25,600—a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth \$1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to \$1.40. Then, as **Figure 17.1 (b)** shows, that investor could start off with £20,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to \$30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately £21,429 in British currency—again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.

Many portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now.

However, you do not know how much this contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let's say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can hedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now—regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time.

Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When parties wish to enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a financial institution or brokerage company to handle the hedging. These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange rate in order to earn money through the service they provide.

Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus.

As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. **Table 17.2** summarizes the main categories of currency demanders and suppliers.

## Participants in the Exchange Rate Market

The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels.

Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as dealers, then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the **interbank market**.

In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all times.

The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are about 23% of global GDP; which is about \$18 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about \$1.5 trillion at the end of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the \$5.3 trillion per day traded in foreign exchange markets.

<Callout>
  Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio
  investment—relatively short-term movements of financial capital between
  currencies. This is due in large part to large foreign exchange dealers'
  actions as they constantly buy and sell with each other.

## Strengthening and Weakening Currency

When the prices of most goods and services change, the price "rises or "falls". For exchange rates, the terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies, we refer to it as appreciating or “strengthening.” When the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, we refer to it as depreciating or "weakening."

<Columns>
<Column>
To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, in **Figure 17.2 (a)**. The vertical axis shows the price of \$1 in U.S. currency, measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for \$1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to \$1.39 Canadian in 1986, depreciated or weakened to \$1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to \$1.60 Canadian by early in 2002. It then fell to roughly \$1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline in 2009 and 2010. In May of 2017, the U.S. dollar stood at \$1.36 Canadian.

The units in which we measure exchange rates can be confusing, because we measure the rate of the U.S. dollar exchange using a different currency—in the example in **Figure 17.2**, the Canadian dollar. However, exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by using a different currency.

In looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other. **Figure 17.2 (b)** shows the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian dollars in **Figure 17.2 (a)**, is a perfect mirror image with the Canadian dollar exchange rate measured in U.S. dollars in **Figure 17.2 (b)**. A fall in the Canada \$/U.S. \$ ratio means a rise in the U.S. \$/Canada \$ ratio, and vice versa.

Higher prices of a typical good or service benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market participants.

<Column>
Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as **Figure 17.3** shows:

(1) U.S. exporters selling abroad;

(2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling imports in the U.S. economy);

(3) U.S. tourists abroad;

(4) foreign tourists visiting the United States;

(5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other countries;

(6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.

For a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the firm's profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country's exports.

Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency, will now buy more home currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country's level of imports.

For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country's currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up \$5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In 2010, \$1 bought 7.3 South African rand, so the tourist had 36,500 rand to spend. In 2012, \$1 bought 8.2 rand, so the tourist had 41,000 rand to spend. By 2015, \$1 bought nearly 13 rand. Clearly, more recent years have been better for U.S. tourists to visit South Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country's currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.

A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.

However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.

The preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in **Figure 17.3** illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions.

### Effects of a Weaker Dollar

Let's work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.

<Steps>

####

Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those
exports, which depends on the dollar price of those goods and the exchange
rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford
pickup truck costs \$25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the
United Kingdom, the price is \$25,000 / \$1.30 per British pound, or
£19,231. The dollar affects the price foreigners face who may purchase
U.S. exports.

####

Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the
pound rises to \$2.00 per pound, then the price of a Ford pickup is now
\$25,000 / \$2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency
buys more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.

####

Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports.
For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the opposite.

####

Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a
grocery store in the United States. If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale
is £6.00 and the exchange rate is \$1.30 per British pound, the price for
the grocery store is 6.00 x \$1.30 = \$7.80 per six pack. If the dollar
weakens to \$2.00 per pound, the price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 x \$2.00 =
\$12.

####

Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar
means that foreign currency is more expensive, which means that foreign
goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S. imports,
which is bad for the foreign exporter.

####

Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a
U.S. importer—they are purchasing a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means
that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign
currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the
tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may choose not to travel at
all.

####

Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker
dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so the cost of a
trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take
longer trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to
take U.S. trips.

####

Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S.
importer—they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a
weaker dollar as an increase in the “price” of investment, since the same
number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign
assets. This should decrease the amount of U.S. investment abroad.

####

Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the
opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more dollars, they will
likely invest in more U.S. assets.

</Steps>

At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the
foreign exchange market: firms involved in international trade, tourists,
international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers.
The next module shows how players can use the tools of demand and supply
in foreign exchange markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger
and weaker currencies (we address “stronger” and “weaker” more in the
following section).

### Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?

One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a “stronger” or “appreciating” currency must be better than a “weaker” or “depreciating” currency. After all, is it not obvious that “strong” is better than “weak”? Do not let the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.
