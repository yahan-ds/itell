We present the history of the U.S. current account balance in recent decades in several different ways. Figure 18.1 (a) shows the current account balance and the merchandise balance in dollar terms. Figure 18.1 (b) shows the current account balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year. By dividing the trade deficit in each year by GDP in that year, Figure 18.1 (b) factors out both inflation and growth in the real economy.

(a) The current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in
billions of dollars from 1960 to 2015. If the lines are above zero dollars,
the United States was running a positive merchandise balance and current
account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the United States is
running a trade deficit and a deficit in its current account balance.

(b) This shows the same items—merchandise balance and current account
balance—in relationship to the size of the U.S. economy, or GDP, from 1960
to 2015.

<Image alt='The first graph shows the current account and merchandise trade balance in nominal dollars. Both lines dropped drastically between 1995 and 2005. In 2013, the current account balance is -422.2, and the merchandise trade balance is -702.284.  The second graph shows the current account and merchandise trade balance as percentages of GDP. Both dropped around 1986, but increased gradually until 1991, when both dropped again with the low around 2005. As of 2013, both current account and merchandise credit are around -2% and -4% of the GDP respectively.' src='/images/module-5/chapter-18/section-2/343dd26f250fa4d83905845c102779e5fa3e2a17.png' width={500} height={800}>

By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. The trade deficit declined again in 2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and has remained stable up through 2016.

**Table 18.4** shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed include Brazil, the largest economy in South America and Latin America more broadly; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea in Asia.

The first column offers one measure of an economy's globalization: exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. The second column shows the trade balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP. As you can see, the U.S. current account balance is -2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.
