As economists see it, trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad, depending on circumstances. The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital. In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital using two models: a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.

## A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday

To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719, was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.

In this hypothetical economy, Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each person's exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.

However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden.

If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.

This parable raises several useful questions in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The first question is:

<Callout>Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit?</Callout>

The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson's irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.

The second question is:

<Callout>What can go wrong?</Callout>

Robinson's proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday's happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps he has been too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay Friday as much as he previously agreed.

Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday's attitude toward these renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.

<Callout>
  A third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists
  between a trade deficit and international borrowing, and between a trade
  surplus and international lending.
</Callout>

The size of Friday's trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson's trade deficit is exactly how much he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital, and a trade deficit means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.

The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage, which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter. The following Work It Out feature walks you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s.

### Calculating Comparative Advantage

In the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. Table 18.5 shows the varying hours of labor requirement.

|               | Wheat (in bushels) | Cloth (in yards) | Relative labor cost of wheat (Pw/Pc) | Relative labor cost of cloth (Pc/Pw) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| United States | 8                  | 9                | 8/9                                  | 9/8                                  |
| Britain       | 4                  | 3                | 4/3                                  | 3/4                                  |

####

Observe from Table 18.5 that, in the United States, it takes eight hours
to supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In
contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours
to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.

####

Note the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage.
Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it
takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also
has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity
cost in cloth ($3/4$ versus $9/8$)). The United States has a comparative
advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of $8/9$ versus $4/3$).

####

Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The
price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of cloth you have to give
up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into
units per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight
hours to make a bushel of wheat, so workers can process 1/8 of a bushel of
wheat in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the
United States, so workers can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour.
If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat
you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one
good (wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).

## The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments

The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments. Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.

**Figure 18.2** shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country—the United States in this example—and the rest of the world.

<Image alt='The illustration shows relationships and transactions between a home country (box on the left) and the rest of the world (box on the right). The home country will provide exports, payment for imports, foreign investment, and investment income paid to the rest of the world. The rest of the world will provide payment for exports, imports, investment income received, and investment from abroad to the home country.' src='/images/module-5/chapter-18/section-3/f303c81936aaf44af5768ee80ca8f352cae41c4f.png'>
**Figure 18.2** Flow of Investment Goods and Capital

The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the financial account.

The bottom four lines in **Figure 18.2** show the flows of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. Investment income stemming from investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into the home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.

A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.

It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may invest in another country—by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.
