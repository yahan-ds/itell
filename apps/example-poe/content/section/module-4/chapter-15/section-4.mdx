Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time. Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources grow as the population and thus the labor force grows, as businesses invest in new capital, and as technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as **Figure 15.8** illustrates.

The original equilibrium occurs at $E_0$, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve $\text{SRAS}_0$, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.

One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to $\text{SRAS}_1$ in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium ($E_1$) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92.

One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right, now to $\text{SRAS}_2$, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to $AD_2$. Now the equilibrium is $E_2$, with an output level of 212 and a price level of 94.

In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.

Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Consider an economy, in which real income increases over time. Increases in real income may increase consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply.

  What happens to government spending and taxes during these shifts?
</Callout>

Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government items such as national defense, social security, and healthcare. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result may be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much, or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.

For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.

## Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government spending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by:

1.Increasing consumption by raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes

2. Increasing investment spending by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes

3. Increasing government purchases through increased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services.

Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.

Consider first the situation in **Figure 15.9**, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2008-2009 recession.

The intersection of aggregate demand ($AD_0$) and aggregate supply ($\text{SRAS}_0$) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium ($E_0$), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD1, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level would rise to P1, the price level associated with the long-run equilibrium and potential GDP.

  Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two,
  to carry out the expansionary fiscal policy?
</Callout>

During the 2008-2009 Great Recession, the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That may not sound like much, but it's more than one year's average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The consensus view is that this was possibly the worst economic downturn in U.S. history since the 1930's Great Depression. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge.

As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement expansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation, the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was partially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending.

The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as “liberal” or “conservative,” or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents. However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending, can use the AD/AS model. Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the government should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely economic one.

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation.

<Columns>
<Column>

As **Figure 15.10** shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand ($AD_0$) and aggregate supply ($\text{SRAS}_0$) occurs at equilibrium $E_0$, which is an output level above potential GDP.

Economists sometimes call this an “overheating economy” where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to $AD_1$, and causing the new equilibrium $E_1$ to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.

Again, the AD/AS model does not dictate how the government should carry out this contractionary fiscal policy. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, the government needs to reduce aggregate demand.
