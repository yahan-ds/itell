The Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation's monetary policy. **Article I, Section 8** of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “to coin money” and “to regulate the value thereof.” As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influence the level of economic activity, as we describe in more detail below.

A central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:

- Open market operations

- Changing reserve requirements

- Changing the discount rate

In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a “bank for banks”—that is, each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.

## Open Market Operations

<Callout>
  The most common monetary policy in the U.S. is open market operations.
</Callout>

Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a short-term interest rate, but one that accurately reflects credit conditions in financial markets.

The **Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)** makes the decisions regarding open market operations. The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting members who the Board draws from the regional Federal Reserve Banks on a rotating basis. The New York district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills the other four spots on an annual rotating basis from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more frequently if necessary.

The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chair has traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks, open market operations have been the most commonly used tool of monetary policy over the last few decades.

To understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in **Figure 14.4. Figure 14.4 (a)** shows that Happy Bank starts with \$460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and \$400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of \$60 million.

<Image alt='The figure shows 3 t-accounts. T-account (a) has the following assets: reserves = 40; bonds = 120; loans = 300. T-account (a) has the following Liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60. T-account (b) has the following assets: reserves = (40 + 20 = 60); bonds = (120 – 20 = 100); loans = 300. T-account (b) has the following liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60. T-account (c) has the following assets: reserves = (60 – 20 = 40); bonds = 100; loans = (300 + 20 = 320). T-account (c) has the following liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60.' src='/images/module-4/chapter-14/section-3/1bdd78220db9ee4a709c747e1a618f6f4e4ec89d.png' width={900} height={600}>

When the central bank purchases \$20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by \$20 million, and the bank's reserves rise by \$20 million, as **Figure 14.4 (b)** shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold \$40 million in reserves, the quantity with which it started in **Figure 14.4 (a)**. The bank, therefore, decides to loan out the extra \$20 million in reserves and its loans rise by \$20 million, as **Figure 14.4 (c)** shows.

The central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking.

Where did the Federal Reserve get the \$20 million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank so that Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air—or with a few clicks on some computer keys.

<Image alt='The figure shows 3 t-accounts. T-account (a) has the following assets: reserves = 40; bonds = 120; loans = 300. T-account (a) has the following Liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60. T-account (b) has the following assets: reserves = (40 – 30 = 10); bonds = (120 + 30 = 150); loans = 300. T-account (b) has the following liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60. T-account (c) has the following assets: reserves = (10 + 30 = 40); bonds = 150; loans = (300 – 30 = 270). T-account (c) has the following liabilities: deposits = 400; net worth = 60.' src='/images/module-4/chapter-14/section-3/f34155f55bf1ea72e61015a1e00860ef9a476af0.png' width={900} height={600}>

Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. **Figure 14.5 (a)** shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank purchases \$30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends \$30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now holds an additional \$30 million in bonds, as **Figure 14.5 (b)** shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold \$40 million in reserves, as in **Figure 14.5 (a)**, so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by \$30 million, to bring its reserves back to the desired level, as **Figure 14.5 (c)** shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking takes effect.

What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money supply? Read the following section for the answer.

### Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?

Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being _outside_ the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.

## Changing Reserve Requirements

<Callout>
  The second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to
  raise or lower the reserve requirement.
</Callout>

The reserve requirement, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank's deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.

In early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first \$14.5 million in deposits, then 3% up to \$103.6 million,and 10% of any amount above \$103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For example, the \$103.6 million dividing line is sometimes raised or lowered by a few million dollars.

In practice, the Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply, while loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks inability to meet withdrawal demands.

## Changing the Discount Rate

<Callout>
  The third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or
  lower the discount rate.
</Callout>

The Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was founded to be the lender of last resort. In the event of a bank run, sound banks (banks that were not bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed's discount “window” to quell the bank run. We call the interest rate banks pay for such loans the **discount rate**. It is so named because the bank makes loans against its outstanding loans “at a discount” of their face value.

Once depositors became convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.

If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.

In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.

The phrase "**to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper**" is contained in the long title of the Federal Reserve Act. Adjusting the discount rate was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created, yet it has been barely used in the last few decades. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do so.
