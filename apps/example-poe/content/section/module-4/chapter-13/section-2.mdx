  Cash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or
  credit cards? Are they money, too?
</Callout>

Rather than trying to argue for a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions based on liquidity. Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. You can use your \$10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, \$10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, \$10 in your savings account is less liquid.

## Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2

The Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money supply.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div className="col-span-1">
    **M1 money supply** includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash,
    checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler's checks.
  </div>
  <div className="col-span-1">
    **M2 money supply** is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings
    and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds.

M1 money supply includes **coins and currency in circulation**—the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable deposits, also known as **demand deposits**. These are the amounts held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the deposit holder his money “on demand” when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items together—currency, and checking accounts in banks—comprise the definition of money known as M1, which the Federal Reserve System measures daily.

A broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example, M2 includes **savings deposits** in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in **money market funds**, where they pool together the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about \$100,000) certificates of deposit (CDs) or **time deposits**, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1.

<Image alt='The figure shows that the components of M1 money supply are part of the M2 money supply. M1 equals coins and currency in circulation plus checkable (demand) deposit plus savings deposits. M2 equals M1 plus money market funds, certificates of deposit, and other time deposits.' src='/images/module-4/chapter-13/section-2/4a6d20035187eebdf301afc64af7c17408da03b3.png'>
**Figure 13.3** The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money

</Image>

**Figure 13.3** should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.

The definition of money M1 and M2 ranged from narrow to broad. The first one is more narrow—M1 = to coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler's checks. The second one is more inclusive— M2 = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.

The Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank's measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was \$3 trillion, while M2 was \$11.8 trillion. **Table 13.1** provides a breakdown of the portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in February 2015, as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank.

The lines separating M1 and M2 can get a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1 alike, accepting traveler's checks or cash while rejecting personal checks for large amounts. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, it is important to know that definitions of money are not as fixed as, say, the definition of nitrogen.

  Where does "plastic money" like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit
  into this picture?
</Callout>

- A debit card, like a check, is an instruction to the user's bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable deposits that are money, not the paper check or the debit card.

- Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, the financial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company.

- With a smart card, you can store a certain amount of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases. Some “smart cards” used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use them for certain purchases or in certain places.

One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts macroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation's banking system has the power to create money.
